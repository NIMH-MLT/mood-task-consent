<h1 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Mood and Motivation Tasks</h1>

<div id="MainText">
    <p>Welcome to&nbsp;the<strong>&nbsp;Mood and Motivations Tasks,</strong>&nbsp;web-based tasks that examines decision-making and rewards. Before taking part in this National Institutes of Health (NIH) research study, please read the script below and click on the &quot;I Agree&quot; button at the bottom of the page if you understand the statements and freely agree to participate in the study.</p>
    
    <p>This study involves web-based tasks designed to learn about decision-making in the context of winning and losing. The study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). For this study, a &quot;session&quot; consists of carrying out one task plus answering questionnaires. A session takes up to 125 minutes.</p>
    
    <p>There are limits on how many sessions you can carry out within one week and within one month. We will not invite you fulfill a session more often than twice in any week, more often than four times in any month or more than six times total. Each session (completing a task and all questionnaires) is independent of any other session and you will be paid for each session that you complete. Always, the decision to carry out one of our sessions is completely up to you</p>
    
    <p>For the entire study you could perform up to a total of six sessions. If you were to fulfill the maximum number of sessions (6) it would take approximately a total of 15 hours, spread out over more than a month.</p>
    
    <p>In this study, each session has two (2) parts, Part I and Part II. Please note: These sessions do not allow for you to take a break; once you start a session, you cannot pause it. Please make sure you have at least 125 minutes to complete both parts of a session before you start.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Part I: The Tasks</h2>
    
    <p>This task involves decision-making, and at times during the task you will be asked to rate your mood. Performing the task takes up to 80 min. Images, digits, or letters will be presented on the monitor and you will have to respond to them as instructed. The task is relatively easy. It will be carefully explained to you. This experiment does not allow for you to take a break; once you start you cannot pause the task. make sure you have at least 80 minutes to complete the task before you start. You will need to complete the task within the 80-minute time.</p>
    
    <h2 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Part II: Questionnaires</h2>
    
    <p>In the second part of the study, you will be asked questions about your age, sex, and work/education level. This is followed by up to 7 questionnaires about your mood and anxiety feelings and how much enjoyment you are having in your day-to-day activities in general. There are up to 200 questions total for all these questionnaires and answering all of them takes no more than 45 minutes. Tasks and questionnaires will be collected via a unique Pavlovia link. You may review their privacy practices on their website (<a href="https://pavlovia.org/docs/home/ethics">https://pavlovia.org/docs/home/ethics</a>).</p>
    
    <p>Subject level responses from this experiment will be publicly shared online, but data will be anonymized prior to sharing. This will include removal of precise date and time information. In other words, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that there is no way to link responses to individuals in the publicly shared data.</p>
    
    <p>Your ID on this platform will be used to distribute payment to you, but NIH will not receive your ID with your survey responses or data. NIH will not have any access to your personal identifiers nor will we attempt to access any personally identifying information about you that you may have put on your public profile page.</p>
    
    <p>Participation is voluntary and the decision to participate in a study is completely up to you. Your refusal to take part in the study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You will be paid $10 for completion of each session plus winnings of around $3 (in the range of $1-$6) based on your performance. You may stop participating in the study at any time. However, since this platform allows us to view only fully completed sessions, we will be unable to compensate you if you do not complete the task.</p>
    
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this study please contact Principal Investigator of the Study, Dr. Dylan Nielson at <a href="mailto:dylan.nielson@nih.gov" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_blank">Dylan.Nielson@nih.gov</a>.</p>
